# Business Site

This week's project was to create a site for a company. It should contain three parts: A hero image with text above it, a signup form and an accordion with a section title that would expand and collapse its description with a click.

## The problem

I started of by making a simple sketch. I decided to use a background image in css for the header. I used flexbox for responsivness and to make my signup form look the way I wanted. I used javascript to make the accordion expand and collapse.

If I had more time I would definitely make the accordion more obvious. Put a plus and minus on the title for example. I would also make a responsive navbar and a fixed footer.
