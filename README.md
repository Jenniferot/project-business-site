# Business Site

This week's project was to create a site for a company. It should contain three parts: A hero image with text above it, a signup form and an accordion with a section title that would expand and collapse its description with a click.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
